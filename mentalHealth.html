All of us are affected by what happens to us, past and present. Things that happened even many years ago can affect our mental health today, for better or worse. Our genes also have an influence.  ”<span

Having good mental health makes life easier. It helps us to calm and comfort ourselves when we’re upset, to cope with the losses, changes, fears and uncertainties in life, to make and keep good relationships with other people and to learn. ”<span style="color: white">"</span>

We might feel under unbearable stress, or often worried about bad things happening to us or people we care about. All of these are very common experiences. 

Feeling down, anxious or stressed can mean we don’t have much energy for activities such as work or study, ‘life admin’ and looking after ourselves and others. It can be hard to keep going. ”<span style="color: white">"</span>
